                <header>what is c++</header>
                <p>C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.
                   C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.
                   C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.
                   The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20.
                   In C#, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

                   int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
                   double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
                   char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
                   string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
                   bool - stores values with two states: true or false</p>

                <header>inheritance</header>
                <p>The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance. Inheritance is one of the most important features of Object-Oriented Programming. 

                    Inheritance is a feature or a process in which, new classes are created from the existing classes. The new class created is called “derived class” or “child class” and the existing class is known as the “base class” or “parent class”. The derived class now is said to be inherited from the base class.In C#, it is possible to inherit fields and methods from one class to another. We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:

                    Derived Class (child) - the class that inherits from another class
                    Base Class (parent) - the class being inherited from
                    To inherit from a class, use the : symbol.
                    
                    In the example below, the Car class (child) inherits the fields and methods from the Vehicle class (parent):</p>

                <header>polymorphism</header>
                <p>Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.

                    Like we specified in the previous chapter; Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.
                    
                    For example, think of a base class called Animal that has a method called animalSound(). Derived classes of Animals could be Pigs, Cats, Dogs, Birds - And they also have their own implementation of an animal sound (the pig oinks, and the cat meows, etc.):</p>

                <header>abstraction</header>
                <p>Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.
                    Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces (which you will learn more about in the next chapter).
                    
                    The abstract keyword is used for classes and methods:
                    
                    Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).
                    
                    Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the derived class (inherited from).</p>
